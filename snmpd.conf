# SECTION: Access Control Setup
#
#   This section defines who is allowed to talk to your running
#   snmp agent.

# rwuser: a SNMPv3 read-write user
#   arguments:  user [noauth|auth|priv] [restriction_oid]

rwuser  admin  

# rocommunity: a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c read-only access community name
#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid]

rocommunity  public default .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4 
rocommunity  secret  

# rwcommunity: a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c read-write access community name
#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid]

# SECTION: Extending the Agent
#
#   You can extend the snmp agent to have it return information
#   that you yourself define.

# exec: run a simple command using exec()
#   arguments:  [oid] name /path/to/executable arguments

exec echotest /bin/echo hello world
exec web_status /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serveradmin status web 
exec netboot /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serveradmin status netboot

# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# proc: Check for processes that should be running.
#     proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#   
#     NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#            exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#     MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#     MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#   
#   The results are reported in the prTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree
#   Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#   you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.

proc httpd

# disk: Check for disk space usage of a partition.
#   The agent can check the amount of available disk space, and make
#   sure it is above a set limit.  
#   
#    disk PATH [MIN=100000]
#   
#    PATH:  mount path to the disk in question.
#    MIN:   Disks with space below this value will have the Mib's errorFlag set.
#           Can be a raw integer value (units of kB) or a percentage followed by the %
#           symbol.  Default value = 100000.
#   
#   The results are reported in the dskTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

disk / 10000

# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation Right here, right now.

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  contact_string

syscontact Administrator <postmaster@example.com>

# sysservices: The proper value for the sysServices object.
#   arguments:  sysservices_number

sysservices 76
